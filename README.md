# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This Weather Dashboard app was created so that a user can see the current day and 5-day forecast of the city of their choice. Their previously searched for cities should also be stored so the user can see this on the website if they want to access it again. This website utilized a server-side weather API to fetch weather data and present it to the user. The use of this API was particularly challenging for me and as I continue to work on it, I hope to get better with using server-side APIs.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this website, the user simply searches for a city of their choice and presses on the "Search" button. Once submitted, the 5-day forecast in addition to the current day forecast should appear on the web page to the right. The user can search as many cities as they want, and their previously searched cities should appear below the search bar. For now, there is a placeholder list of cities that the user can search for. The weather API currently does not fetch properly, so this will be improved upon.
